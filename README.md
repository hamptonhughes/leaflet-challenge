## Decription

For this project, I have built a web visualization of earthquakes in the last seven days using leaflet and javascript.  Each earthquake is denoted by a circle marker, whose size is determined by the magnitude of the earthquake.  There is also a shading component, which reflects the depth of th earthquake.  

The visualization can be viewed in github pages here: https://hamptonhughes.github.io/leaflet-challenge/

## Installations

No installations are necessary to view the web visulization.
